# RTK Query Media

Welcome to the **RTK Query Media** project! This project is aimed at learning and practicing advanced concepts in **Redux** using **Redux Thunk** and **RTK Query**. It is a hands-on project that explores asynchronous operations and API handling in a React/Redux environment.

This repository is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://sksamassa.github.io/rtk-query-media/) and can be accessed live.

## Purpose of the Project

The **RTK Query Media** project was created with the primary goal of deepening the understanding of:
- **Redux Thunk** for managing asynchronous operations in Redux.
- **RTK Query**, the powerful data-fetching and caching tool provided by Redux Toolkit.

By building this project, you will:
- Explore asynchronous logic using Redux Thunk.
- Learn how to efficiently fetch, cache, and manage data using RTK Query.
- Develop a better understanding of managing API states in modern React applications.

## Features

- **Redux Async Thunk**: Learn how to handle complex async flows.
- **RTK Query**: Implement efficient data fetching with automatic caching and invalidation.
- **React**: Combine Redux state management with React components.
- **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Experience how to deploy React apps using GitHub Pages.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite**: Fast build tool for modern web projects, providing a development server and bundler.
- **React**: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Redux Toolkit**: The official, recommended way to write Redux logic.
  - **Redux Thunk**: Middleware for handling async logic in Redux.
  - **RTK Query**: Tool for managing server-side data fetching and caching.
- **classnames**: Utility for conditionally applying CSS classes.
- **faker.js** (@faker-js): Library to generate fake data for testing.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Language used for building the app.
- **GitHub Pages**: For deploying the project.
